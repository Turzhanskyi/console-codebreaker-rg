  rules:
    - 'Codebreaker is a logic game in which a codebreaker tries to break a secret code created by a code-generator. The code-generator, which will be played by the application weâ€™re going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6.'
    - 'The codebreaker gets some code of chances to break the code (depends on chosen difficulty). In each turn, the codebreaker makes a guess of 4 numbers. The code-generator then marks the guess with up to 4 signs - + or - or empty spaces.'
    - 'A + indicates an exact match: one of the codes in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position. For example:'
    - 'Secret code - 1234'
    - 'Input code - 6264'
    - 'Number of pluses - 2 (second and fourth position)'
    - 'A - indicates a code match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code but in a different position. For example:'
    - 'Secret code - 1234'
    - 'Input code - 6462'
    - 'Number of minuses - 2 (second and fourth position)'
    - 'An empty space indicates that there is not a current digit in a secret code.'
    - 'If codebreaker inputs the exact code as a secret code - codebreaker wins the game. If all attempts are spent - codebreaker loses.'
    - 'Codebreaker also has some code of hints (depends on chosen difficulty). If a user takes a hint - he receives back a separate digit of the secret code.'
